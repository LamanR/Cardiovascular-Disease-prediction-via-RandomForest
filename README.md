# Cardiovascular-Disease-prediction-via-RandomForest
The dataset cardio_train.csv consists of 70 000 records of patients data in 12 features. The task is to predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using the patient examination results 
Task involved following steps:
1. Uploading dataset to MySql via Python and do some data cleaning in MySql
   (mysql_connection.py, cardio_eda.py and cardio.sql)
3. Fethcing cleaned data back to Python and do further EDA.
5. Perform feature engineering and extract new features.
6. Write new dataset to csv file to perform modelling.
   (cardio_eda.py, cardio_output.csv)
7. Feature importance, modelling and hyperparameters steps and final results

8. Presentation: cardio_prez, cardio_prez_plots.py
